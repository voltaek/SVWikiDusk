## Description
The Stardew Valley wiki, but darkened as though it was dusk. As much of the original look and feel was maintained as possible, by adjusting and re-using existing colors wherever possible.

### Darkening Notes
Pretty much all of these colors are the original site colors converted to HSL with their Lightness then adjusted by 30% to 60%, up or down, depending on the context.

### Intended Application
These adjustments were all made to be applied on top of the wiki's "Legacy" Vector skin. Most of them will probably still work without the "Legacy" option on, but likely none will work with the MinervaNeue skin, though as that skin leaves the site mostly white and plain, it doesn't look like it has been developed/configured.
